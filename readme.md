PDQj is based on the retired Gamewright game called PDQ. I wanted to buy the game for my niece last year and discovered it is no longer for sale, so I made my own. This is my first medium-size web app written in plain old js. Nothing too elegant, but fun for the whole family! It's a pretty straightforward word-making card game with simple mechanics. A short set of instructions is located in the html file.
